## TODO
- [ ] Create requirements file for easy setup.
- [ ] Write readme introduction.
- [ ] Implement algorithm from density, stretch, and angle to k-foams graph.
- [ ] Turn k-foams graph to mesh.
- [ ] 3D-print a arbitrary stl file. 
- [ ] 3D-print k-foams mesh.
- [ ] Write instructions.

## In Progress
- [ ] Find relevant tools.
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) for arguments to k-foams graph.
  - [Pymesh](https://pymesh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) to turn graph into stl file.
  - Matplotlib
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/3d-scatter-plots/)
  - Need to play with printing a dummy stl file.
  

## Done âœ“
- [x] Upload an initial readme.
- [x] Turn an arbitrary graph to mesh.
- [x] Save a graph to mesh.
- [x] Save mesh as stl.
- [x] Create an example jupyter notebook.
